# sam-devcontainer

A curated collection of devcontainer features used by **SAM ROS 2**.  
Features are organized under the `features/` directory, and prebuilt configurations are stored in the `prebuild/` directory.

Each feature is self-contained and includes detailed documentation within its respective folder.

‚ö†Ô∏è **Important:**
When updating a feature, **always increment its version number**, ideally following [Semantic Versioning (SemVer)](https://semver.org/). The DevContainer CLI skips publishing if a version tag already exists.
Re-publishing an existing version requires manually deleting the tag from the container registry which is strongly discouraged.
