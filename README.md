# sam-devcontainer

A curated collection of devcontainer features used by **SAM ROS 2**.  
Features are organized under the `features/` directory, and prebuilt configurations are stored in the `prebuild/` directory.

Each feature is self-contained and includes detailed documentation within its respective folder.

‚ö†Ô∏è **Important:**
When updating a feature, **always increment its version number**, ideally following [Semantic Versioning (SemVer)](https://semver.org/). The DevContainer CLI skips publishing if a version tag already exists.
Re-publishing an existing version requires manually deleting the tag from the container registry which is strongly discouraged.

## üîß Build

The build process is automated using a GitLab CI pipeline, but you can also build manually:

### üõ†Ô∏è Manual Build

```bash
# publish to sam-devcontainer
CI_REGISTRY_IMAGE=sam-dev.cs.hm.edu:5023/sam-dev/sam-devcontainer

# publish to ros2/sam-devcontainer (main repo)
CI_REGISTRY_IMAGE=sam-dev.cs.hm.edu:5023/sam-dev/ros2/sam-devcontainer

# for amd64
devcontainer build \
  --workspace-folder prebuild \
  --image-name $CI_REGISTRY_IMAGE:amd64 \
  --platform linux/amd64

# for arm64
devcontainer build \
  --workspace-folder prebuild \
  --image-name $CI_REGISTRY_IMAGE:arm64 \
  --platform linux/arm64

# manually create one "latest" manifest that refereces both images
docker manifest create $CI_REGISTRY_IMAGE:latest $CI_REGISTRY_IMAGE:amd64 $CI_REGISTRY_IMAGE:arm64
docker manifest annotate $CI_REGISTRY_IMAGE:latest $CI_REGISTRY_IMAGE:amd64 --os linux --arch amd64
docker manifest annotate $CI_REGISTRY_IMAGE:latest $CI_REGISTRY_IMAGE:arm64 --os linux --arch arm64
docker manifest push $CI_REGISTRY_IMAGE:latest
